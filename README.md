# Magic: the Gathering - Batch Event Manager

This is a software to create and manage Batch Events for Magic: the Gathering.
Batches are great when you need to run multiple swiss rounds simultaneously.

You can create batches with both random and/or standings based pairings.

Report matches and end the batch when all matches are reported.

Standings* and pairings* are calculated and generated according to 
Magic: the Gathering tournament documentation.
