Magic: the Gathering - Batch Event Manager

This is a software to create and manage Batch Events for Magic: the Gathering.
Batches are great when you need to run multiple rounds of swiss simultaneously.

You can create batches with both random and standings based pairings.

Report matches and end the batch when all matches are reported.

Standings* and pairings* are calculated and generated according to 
Magic: the Gathering tournament documentation.
